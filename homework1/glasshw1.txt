Note: This version of the dataset was modified for use
in CS6923, Machine Learning, by L. Hellerstein in Feb. 2018.  
(The original dataset classified the glass into 7 classes: 4 types of window
glass classes, and 3 types of non-window glass classes.  This version
treats all 4 types of window glass classes as one class, and all 3 types of
non-window glass classes as one class.)

       -- General Results: nearest neighbor held its own with respect to the
             rule-based system

4. Relevant Information:
      Vina conducted a comparison test of her rule-based system, BEAGLE, the
      nearest-neighbor algorithm, and discriminant analysis.  BEAGLE is 
      a product available through VRS Consulting, Inc.; 4676 Admiralty Way,
      Suite 206; Marina Del Ray, CA 90292 (213) 827-7890 and FAX: -3189.
      In determining whether the glass was a type of "float" glass or not,
      the following results were obtained (# incorrect answers):

             Type of Sample                            Beagle   NN    DA
             Windows that were float processed (87)     10      12    21
             Windows that were not:            (76)     19      16    22

      The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by 
      criminological investigation.  At the scene of the crime, the glass left
      can be used as evidence...if it is correctly identified!
